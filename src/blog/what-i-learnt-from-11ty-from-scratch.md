## What did I learn?
This is what I am learning while making 11ty website from scratch using the post:
1. It is fun as long as I am curious. It does not seem like effort when I think myself as a beginner and expect mistakes to be committed.
2. Documenting the steps helps in remembering and getting back.
3. If I think of myself as a beginner, I am ready to fail and ready to grow. I am enjoying the process as long as I am having this attitude.
4. Everyone is playing and are ready to help on internet and in the online community. All I have to do is ask
   
## What did I learn from 11ty post?
This is what I am learning of 11ty till now:
1. Package.json is an important tool to write my scripts for server.
2. .eleventy.js controls the functionality of 11ty and basic scripts that are running inside 11ty can be written here.
3. Templating can be done with help of nunjucks file.
4. Collection of posts can be templated with help of json file
5. MD files do not support njk syntax. Made the tweak of including blog.njk file and containing the njk file in it. The CSS files got disrupted because of file heirarchy. I will need to search a simple solution for that.
