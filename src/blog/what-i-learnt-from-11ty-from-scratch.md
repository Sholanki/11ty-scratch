This is what I am learning while making 11ty website from scratch using the post:
1. It is fun as long as I am curious. It does not seem like effort when I think myself as a beginner and expect mistakes to be committed.
2. Documenting the steps helps in remembering and getting back.
3. If I think of myself as a beginner, I am ready to fail and ready to grow. I am enjoying the process as long as I am having this attitude.
4. Everyone is playing and are ready to help on internet and in the online community. All I have to do is ask
