        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hi! I am Sholanki. This is another one of 11ty creations that I am doing through 11ty.rocks website.</p>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>Currently, I am playing and tinkering around with 11ty and see what I come up with. 11ty is a new toy for me which I am enjoying and playing with. I also like to write; I usually write when I am morose and when I am slumped over, it requires nudging and pushing</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, I love to get into the fun part without doing the effort part in the beginning. I realised that it simply doesn't work that way and I became inconsistent in writing. So, here's effort from my side to understand 11ty and to get started with the basics so I can play around.</p>
