        <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
<p>This is what I am learning while making 11ty website from scratch using the post:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is fun as long as I am curious. It does not seem like effort when I think myself as a beginner and expect mistakes to be committed.</li>
<li>Documenting the steps helps in remembering and getting back.</li>
<li>If I think of myself as a beginner, I am ready to fail and ready to grow. I am enjoying the process as long as I am having this attitude.</li>
<li>Everyone is playing and are ready to help on internet and in the online community. All I have to do is ask</li>
</ol>
<h2>What did I learn from 11ty post?</h2>
