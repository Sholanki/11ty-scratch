        <h1>What I learnt from &#39;11ty from scratch&#39; post</h1>
        <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
<p>This is what I am learning while making 11ty website from scratch using the post:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is fun as long as I am curious. It does not seem like effort when I think myself as a beginner and expect mistakes to be committed.</li>
<li>Documenting the steps helps in remembering and getting back.</li>
<li>If I think of myself as a beginner, I am ready to fail and ready to grow. I am enjoying the process as long as I am having this attitude.</li>
<li>Everyone is playing and are ready to help on internet and in the online community. All I have to do is ask</li>
</ol>
<h2>What did I learn from 11ty post?</h2>
<p>This is what I am learning of 11ty till now:</p>
<ol>
<li>Package.json is an important tool to write my scripts for server.</li>
<li>.eleventy.js controls the functionality of 11ty and basic scripts that are running inside 11ty can be written here.</li>
<li>Templating can be done with help of nunjucks file.</li>
<li>Collection of posts can be templated with help of json file</li>
<li>MD files do not support njk syntax. Made the tweak of including blog.njk file and containing the njk file in it. The CSS files got disrupted because of file heirarchy. I will need to search a simple solution for that.</li>
</ol>
